In this file, we provide the synthetic network data that we work on in the **Section 4** simulation studies of the [**"A Zero-Inflated Poisson Latent Position Cluster Model" (ZIP-LPCM)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13790) paper.
The publicly available real network data we work on in the **Section 5** real data applications is also provided here.

The [`.csv`] files with the names beginning with `SS1_Scenario1`, `SS1_Scenario2`, `SS2_Scenario1`, `SS2_Scenario2` are the synthetic network data generated, respectively, in simulation study 1 scenario 1, simulation study 1 scenario 2, simulation study 2 scenario 1, simulation study 2 scenario 2, which are provided in **Section 4.1 and 4.2** of the paper.
The [`.txt`] file with the name `windsurfers` is the network data of the **windsurfers** network we work on in **Section 5.2** of the paper.
The [`.txt`] file with the name `train_bombing` is the network data of the **Train Bombing** network we work on in **Section 5.3** of the paper.
The [`.csv`] files with the names beginning with `CriminalNet` are the network data of the **Summit Co-attendance Criminality** network we work on in **Section 5.4** of the paper.
The **Sampson Monks** network data can be directly obtained from the `latentnet` package.
